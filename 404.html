        <h2 class="font-cursive">The First Date</h2>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Gus's version</h3>
        <p>
          Our first date started on a fancy rooftop bar in Hell's Kitchen. I
          wanted to impress Aaron. I failed miserably. Aaron couldn't care less
          about that. Luckily, she didn't give up and decided to save the night.
          We went to an irish pub and spent the night drinking beer and shooting
          darts (it was the best!). Our first kiss was a week after that, on a
          snowy night, outside a subway station in Times Square. She kissed me,
          by the way, and I'll forever brag about it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Aaron's version'</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h2 class="font-cursive">The Proposal</h2>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Gus's version</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to propose in a special way. So I tried my best to get the
          right ring and the right place. Well, I got the ring right at least. I
          wanted to go to this beautiful garden in the Bronx, and because we
          were gonna travel soon, we had only one day where we were both free.
          It was a Monday and the garden was closed... Not even the Botanical
          Garden was open. Desperate, I searched online and thought I had found
          a good spot to do it, so we went there for a picnic. It was hot, we
          were basically on a trail, I was carrying bags, and there was this
          weird guy just standing there in the woods alone, that creeped me out
          a little bit. We got to the end of the trail and it was not so bad, it
          had a good view of the Hudson. We put the hammock up, then I gathered
          all my courage, got on one knee, pulled out the box and she started
          laughing. Not kidding. She managed to say yes between laughs,
          thankfully, but it was all very confusing to me. I love that memory.

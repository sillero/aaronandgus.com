        <h2 class="font-cursive">The First Date</h2>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Gus' version</h3>
        <p>
          Our first date started on a fancy rooftop bar in Hell's Kitchen. I
          wanted to impress Aaron. I failed miserably. Aaron couldn't care less
          about that. Luckily, she didn't give up and decided to save the night.
          We went to an irish pub and spent the night drinking beer and shooting
          darts (it was the best!). Our first kiss was a week after that, on a
          snowy night, outside a subway station in Times Square. She kissed me,
          by the way, and I'll forever brag about it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Aaron's version'</h3>
        <p>
          Gus and I met at a swanky hotel bar on West 47th St and 11th Ave on a
          cold, January day. The bar was near where the cruise ships dock so I
          think tourists go there for fancy nights out. It wasn't exactly my
          scene. Since first dates are usually a bit awkward, I needed something
          to do other than just sit next to this handsome stranger and talk
          about first date things. After downing my $16 pinot grigio, I
          suggested we go to one of my favorite bars in Hell's Kitchen, The Gaf.
          I had learned to play darts there when I was doing a show for a few
          months at an Off Broadway theatre nearby. Darts is a perfect first
          date activity. It gives you something to do, which takes the pressure
          off filling any awkward silences. And you have a sharp object in your
          hand in case your date gets creepy. Luckily, I didn't need the dart
          for anything but hitting bulls eyes ( I won.) Like the gentleman he
          is, Gus walked me to the train later that evening. On the way to the
          train, I stepped in a hole and twisted my ankle. Gus asked if I was
          okay, to which I responded more loudly than I meant to, "I'm FINE!
          Let's keep going!" I spent the next day on the couch icing my ankle,
          which caused me to cancel another date with a different guy. In
          hindsight, I'm pretty grateful for that hole.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-cursive">The Proposal</h2>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Gus' version</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to propose in a special way. So I tried my best to get the
          right ring and the right place. Well, I got the ring right at least. I
          wanted to go to this beautiful garden in the Bronx, and because we
          were gonna travel soon, we had only one day where we were both free.
          It was a Monday and the garden was closed... Not even the Botanical
          Garden was open. Desperate, I searched online and thought I had found
          a good spot to do it, so we went there for a picnic. It was hot, we
          were basically on a trail, I was carrying bags, and there was this
          weird guy just standing there in the woods alone, that creeped me out
          a little bit. We got to the end of the trail and it was not so bad, it
          had a good view of the Hudson. We put the hammock up, then I gathered
          all my courage, got on one knee, pulled out the box and she started
          laughing. Not kidding. She managed to say yes between laughs,
          thankfully, but it was all very confusing to me. I love that memory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-cursive">Aaron's version</h3>
        <p>
          I was annoyed at Gus for insisting that we go to a park in the Bronx
          on a Monday afternoon. For one, I was furiously packing up my
          apartment so that I could move in with him. I had like two free days
          to pack my things before I had to finish directing a show at a summer
          camp and then leave for Ireland for ten days. I made no effort,
          whatsoever, for this date. I was in a sweaty t-shirt, no make up, and
          unflattering khaki capris. For better or worse, right? Gus takes me to
          this "park". It's more of a random wooded area with some trail-like
          paths. The plan was to find a spot, set up a hammock, and have a
          picnic. After walking for about 45 minutes, we reached a suitable
          spot. We set up the hammock. I was standing on one end of the hammock,
          and he was standing on the other taking in the view of the Hudson
          River and the Palisades. He said, "Come here. The view is beautiful."
          Because I could see it fine from where I was, I obliviously replied,
          "It looks nice from here too." I clearly hadn't taken the hint so he
          persisted, " Can you please just come over here?" The next thing I
          knew, he was down on one knee saying beautifully sweet things that I
          wish I could remember. He pulled out a gorgeous wooden box that he
          freaking WHITTLED, opened it, and there was the most beautiful ring
          ever made. Seriously, one day hobbits will climb mountains for this
          ring. It's custom made and features an aquamarine from his home state
          in Brazil. Aquamarine also happens to be my birthstone. I mean, c'mon!
          My body couldn't handle the joy, shock, and disbelief of it all. This
          resulted in me laughing hysterically for the next twenty minutes
          thoroughly confusing him. I did manage a "yes", in there somewhere.
